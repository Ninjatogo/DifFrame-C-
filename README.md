# DifFrame-C#
C# implementation of DifFrame utility

## TODO
- Complete functionality for frame reassembly
- Save frame collector data to some sort of database for processing progress persistance
- Open frame processor for more output customization (e.g. frame block border size)
- Implement multi-workstation workload sharing
- Implement input frame on-demand frame generation from video files using FFMPEG (no more manually extracting and maintaining huge folder of frames)
- Implement GUI component
